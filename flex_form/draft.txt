request: localhost/options/animals (select * from animals)
request: localhost/options/people (select * from people)

Use Html select for the drop down options

select
	<option ng-repeat...>
select

- Get array of options => [animals, animals,animals, sizes...]
- Find duplicate, replace into one record => [animals, size] We only want to query the options once
- Query the options
- Return options in sets 

<select ng-model="orderProp" ng-options="place.category for place in places | unique:'category'">
    <option value="0">Default</option>
    // unique options from the categories
</select>
